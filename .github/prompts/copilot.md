Rules:
1. If you want to test the code in the "agent" folder use "uv run" and for installing new libs use "uv add" which updates automatically the pyproject.toml
2. If you want to test the code in the "services" folder use python3 and for installing new libs here use "pip3" and update the requirements.txt file
