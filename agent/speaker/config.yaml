# Speaker Agent configuration
#
# This agent uses Microsoft Agent Framework + the MCP server provided by:
#   services/speak
#
# The OpenAI API key is read from the repo root `.env` (OPENAI_API_KEY=...).

agent:
  name: SpeakerAgent

  # Used by agent/speaker/main.py when you don't pass --text
  default_text: "Hallo!"

  # System instructions for the LLM.
  # Keep this strict so the agent actually calls the MCP tool.
  instructions: |
    You are the robot's text-to-speech assistant.

    You MUST use the provided MCP tool to speak.
    Never claim you spoke unless you called the tool.

    - To speak, call tool `speak` with {text: <string>}.
      Then return ONLY the tool result.
